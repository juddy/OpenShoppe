#
# <jcl-install-dir>/sample
# Root of all JCL sample and demo src files.
# Build the JCL (see <jcl-install-dir>/build.xml for details)
# then run the sample demo application by following these steps:
# 1) Set your CLASSPATH to include the JCL and JavaPOS controls---the 
#    <jcl-install-dir>/lib/jpos1<x>.jar is a one shot file that you can use for that
#    purpose
# 2) Extract the <jcl-install-dir>/lib/jcl_sample_src.jar in the <jcl-install-dir>/sample
#    directory (if necessary)
# 3) Build the <jcl-install-dir>/sample sources by issuing command:
#    %javac com/xyz/*.java
#    %javav com/xyz/jpos/*.java
# 2) Go to <jcl-install-dir>/sample and assuming the CLASSPATH includes "." or current 
#    directory then run:
#    %java com.xyz.TestApp
# 3) The sample.xml file provided can be used to see how one can use 
#    the XML file to configure devices--an example of the Virtual LD
#    device is provided
