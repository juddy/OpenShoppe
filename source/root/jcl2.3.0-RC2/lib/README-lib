# <jcl-install-dir>/lib
# Root of all JCL binary files (i.e. JAR files) this directory is needed to build JCL
# All generated JAR files will also be added to this directory.  You can always see
# the contents of a JAR file by using the jar tvf <jarfileName>.jar command.
# The following is a list of the generated files with short description:
# 1) jcl.jar --- the .class for the core JCL only (w/o controls)
# 2) jcl_src.jar --- the .java source files for the core JCL
# 3) jcl_editor.jar --- the .class for the JCL editor only as well as other 
#    necessary resource files
# 4) jcl_editor_src.jar --- the .java source for the editor and necessary 
#    resource files
# 5) jcl_sample.jar --- the .class files for the JCL sample example 
# 6) jcl_sample_src.jar --- the .java source for the JCL sample example
# 7) jcl_test.jar --- the .class file for the JUnit tests
# 8) jcl_test_src.jar --- the .java and resource data files for the JCL JUnit tests
# 9) jpos1<x>-controls.jar --- generated JAR file with the .class of the controls 
#    sources found from the JavaPOS web site: http://www.javapos.com
# 10) jpos1<x>.jar --- generated combined JavaPOS controls and JCL .class files
# 11) README-lib --- this readme file
# 
# NOTE: In the above items 9)  and 10) <x> == 5, 6, and 7 and stands for the JavaPOS
# controls version 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 respectively
